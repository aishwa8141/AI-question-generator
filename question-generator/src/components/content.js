            <p>
              Domestic dogs inherited complex behaviors, such as bite
              inhibition, from their wolf ancestors, which would have been pack
              hunters with complex body language. These sophisticated forms of
              social cognition and communication may account for their
              trainability, playfulness, and ability to fit into human
              households and social situations, and these attributes have given
              dogs a relationship with humans that has enabled them to become
              one of the most successful species on the planet today.
            </p>
            <p>
              The dogs' value to early human hunter-gatherers led to them
              quickly becoming ubiquitous across world cultures. Dogs perform
              many roles for people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads,
              protection, assisting police and military, companionship, and,
              more recently, aiding handicapped individuals. This impact on
              human society has given them the nickname "man's best friend" in
              the Western world. In some cultures, however, dogs are also a
              source of meat.
